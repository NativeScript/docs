Marshalling in NativeScript refers to the conversion of JavaScript data types to native platform language (Swift/Objective C and Kotlin/Java) data types and vice versa.

The conversion is handled implicitly by the NativeScript iOS and Android runtimes.

For more information about how NativeScript converts data types for each platform, read the following articles:
