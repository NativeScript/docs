title: Platform Version Handling
---

There are several key things to understand about platform version handling (eg: Android, iOS, visionOS, macOS, Meta Quest, etc.) within the scope of your NativeScript project.

As customary with JavaScript ecosystem handling, maintaining `package.json` dependency version handling is quite familiar with JavaScript developers in general. We recommend [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_tools/Package_management) as well as [our overview here](https://docs.nativescript.org/guide/development-workflow/using-packages#package-managers) if not familiar with package managers.

This focuses on a topic beyond the JavaScript ecosystem -- How you can manage platform versions in different circumstances.
