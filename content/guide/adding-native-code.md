title: Adding custom native code to a project
---


NativeScript allows you to access any native APIs anytime in your app. If the native API you need is not exposed through [@nativescript/core](https://docs.nativescript.org/understanding-packages#nativescript-core) or [third party plugins](https://market.nativescript.org/) or [@nativescript/* plugins](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/index.html)), you can add it to your project and access it right away in TypeScript.


1. Add native code to [App_Resources](/project-structure/app-resources). For example, see [Adding Java/Kotlin code to an application](/project-structure/app-resources#adding-java-kotlin-code-to-an-application) and [Adding ObjectiveC/Swift Code to an application](/project-structure/app-resources#adding-objectivec-swift-code-to-an-application)

2. Generate types for the added APIs
For iOS types run:

```cli
ns typings ios
```

For Android run:

```cli
ns typings android --jar <.jar path>
```

3. Reference the generated types in [references.d.ts](/project-structure/references-d-ts-in-nativescript)

4. You can now code (_strongly typed_) against the platform native APIs. For various examples on how to interact with native API's in JavaScript/TypeScript, visit the [Subclassing](/guide/subclassing/), [iOS Marshalling](/guide/marshalling/nativescript-ios-marshalling) and [Android Marshalling](/guide/marshalling/nativescript-android-marshalling) pages
