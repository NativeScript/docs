Most of the application logic lives in the `src` folder (sometimes named `app`). The general structure can vary, and will depended on the falvor you are using.

## Typical Folder Structure

<!-- tab: Vue with JavaScript -->

```bash
src/
  components/
    Home.vue
  app.css
  main.js
```

<!-- tab: Vue with TypeScript -->

```bash
src/
  components/
    Home.vue
  types/
  app.css
  main.ts
```

<!-- tab: Plain with JavaScript -->

```bash
...
```
