NativeScript applications are bundled using webpack. The bundling process can be further customized via the `webpack.config.js`.

### Default webpack config

By default, the webpack config will automatically configure everything for your project, and should looks something like this:

```js
const webpack = require('@nativescript/webpack')

module.exports = (env) => {
  webpack.init(env)

  // Learn how to customize:
  // https://docs.nativescript.org/webpack

  return webpack.resolveConfig()
}
```
