title: Color
description: Create a color object with any color representation and use it in your NativeScript apps.
---

The `Color` class enables the creation of a color object:

- using color components (alpha, red, green, blue) ranging from 0 to 255,
- using various color representations like ARGB, color names, hex values, and more.

The `ios` and `android` properties of the `Color` class instance return the native platform instance of [UIColor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor) on iOS and [Color](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Color) on Android.

## How to use the Color class

<!-- Preview: https://stackblitz.com/edit/nativescript-stackblitz-templates-x2y7k6?file=app/main-view-model.ts -->

### Create a color object from a hex value

```ts
const color = new Color('#FF00CC')
const colorShortHex = new Color('#F0C')
```

### Create a color object from an alpha value

```ts
const colorARGB = new Color(100, 255, 100, 100)
```

## Color API

The Color class offers the following properties and methods.

### constructor

Creates a color object. The Color class offers the following constructor overloads:

```ts
const color = new Color(knownColor)
```

Creates a Color instance from a known color name.

- `knownColor` : A color name string such as `'red'`, `'purple'`, `'orange'`.

```ts
const color = new Color(hex)
```

Creates a Color instance from a color hexidecimal code.

- `hex`: A string of a hexidecimal color value such as `'#fff'` or `'#FF00CC'`.

```ts
const color = new Color(argb)
```

Creates a Color instance from a number representing a color with an alpha.

- `argb`: A number such as `4293377432` as, representing color.

```ts
const color = new Color(alpha: number, red: number, green:number, blue: number, type?: 'rgb' | 'hsl' | 'hsv')
```

---

```ts
colorAlpha: number = color.a
```

---

### argb

colorARGB: number = color.argb
```

Gets the Argb Number representation of this color where each 8 bits represent a single color component. This is a `read-only` property.

colorHex: string = color.hex
```

Gets the Hexadecimal string representation of the color.

---

### name

```ts
colorName: string = color.name

---

### android

```ts
androidColor = color.android

---

### ios

```ts
iOSColor: UIColor = color.ios

---

### Color.equals()

```ts
areColorsEqual: boolean = Color.equals(value1: Color, value2: Color)
```

A static Color class method that compares two `Color` instances and returns `true` if they are the same or `false` otherwise.

---

### Color.isValid()

```ts
isValidColorValue: boolean = Color.isValid(value)
```

A static Color class method that validates if a value can be converted to a color.

---

### Color.fromIosColor()

```ts
colorFromIosColor: Color = Color.fromIosColor(value)
```

Creates a Color instance from iOS-specific UIColor value representation. `value` is of type [UIColor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor).

---

### Color.mix()

```ts
colorMix: Color = Color.mix(color1: Color, color2: Color, amount: number)
```

A static method that creates a Color instance from mixture of two colors.

---

### Color.fromHSL()

```ts
colorNew: Color = Color.fromHSL(a, h, s, l)
```

A static method that returns a new Color from HSL.

---

### Color.fromHSV()

```ts
colorNew: Color = Color.fromHSV(a, h, s, v)
```

A static method that returns a new Color from HSV.

---

### equals()

```ts
color.equals(value)
```

A Color instance method that checks whether the color instance on which the method is called equals the Color instance passed to the method.

---

### isDark()

```ts
color.isDark()
```

A Color instance method that returns `true` if the color is dark or returns`false` otherwise. A color is dark when `brightenss < 128`.

---

### isLight()

```ts
color.isLight()
```

A Color instance method that returns `true` if the color is light or returns`false` otherwise.A color is light when `brightenss >= 128`

---

### getBrightness()
