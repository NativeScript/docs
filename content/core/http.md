Http provides utility methods to make all sorts of http networking requests.

## Using Http

### GET request with a response body as a string

A simple way to make a GET request returning a response as a string is to use the [getString()](#getstring) method:

```ts
Http.getString('https://httpbin.org/get').then(
  (result: string) => {
    // do something with the string response
  },
  (e) => {}
)
```

### GET request with a response body as JSON

Use the [getJSON()](#getjson) method for a GET request with a response as a JSON:

```ts
Http.getJSON('https://httpbin.org/get').then(
  (result) => {
    console.log(result)
  },
  (e) => {}
)
```

### GET request with a response body as a file

Use the [getFile()](#getfile) method for a GET request with a response as a [File]():

```ts
Http.getFile(
  'https://art.nativescript.org/logo/export/NativeScript_Logo_Wide_White_Blue_Rounded_Blue.png'
).then(
  (resultFile: File) => {
    // The returned result will be File object
  },
  (e) => {}
)
```

### GET request with a response body as an image

Use the [getImage()](#getimage) method for a GET request with a response as an image([ImageSource]()):

```ts
Http.getImage('https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg').then(
  (res: ImageSource) => {},
  (e) => {}
)
```

:::tip Note
The above methods can also take, instead of the url string, an [HttpRequestOptions](#httprequestoptions-interface) object. Also, alternatively to the above methods, you can use the [request](#) method and call the appropriate(e.g `.toJSON()`, `.toString()`) method on the [HttpResponse](#httpresponse-interface) object's `content` to get the response type you want.
:::

### Making a POST request

To make a POST request, use the [request()](#request) method:

```ts
Http.request({
  url: 'https://httpbin.org/get',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  content: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'tony',
    password: 'pass',
  }),
}).then(
  (response) => {
    const result = response.content?.toJSON()
  },
  (e) => {
    // error
  }
)
```
