description: Work with the device file system
---

File system handing with @nativescript/core provides easy-to-use APIs for working with files and folders in a device's file system like managing files, folders, paths, and separators, etc.

## How to work with files and folders

### Accessing the Documents folder

To get the root Documents folder, call the `documents()` method on `knownFolders`:

```ts
import { knownFolders } from '@nativescript/core'

const documents = knownFolders.documents()
```

### Accessing the temporary(Caches) folder

```ts
import { knownFolders } from '@nativescript/core'

const cache = knownFolders.temp()
```

### Accessing the root folder for the app

```ts
import { knownFolders } from '@nativescript/core'

const appRootFolder = knownFolders.currentApp()
```

### Creating a folder

To create a folder, call the `getFolder()` method on an instance of `Folder` (any of the root folders above or one you create) and pass it the name of the folder.

```ts
folder.getFolder('folder-name')
```

You can also use the [fromPath](#frompath) static method of the Folder class.

```ts
const folderPath = path.join(knownFolders.documents().path, 'music')
const folder: Folder = Folder.fromPath(folderPath)
```

### Renaming a folder

To rename a folder, use the `rename` or `renameSync` method:

```ts
folder
  .rename(newName)
  .then((res) => {
    // Folder Successfully renamed.
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    //Folder couldn't be renamed
    console.error(err)
  })
```

### Check if a folder exists

```ts
const folderExists: boolean = Folder.exists('folder-path')
```

### Accessing a folder's content

To get a folder's files and folders, use the `getEntitiesSync` or `getEntities` method:

```ts
folder
  .getEntities()
  .then((entities: FileSystemEntity[]) => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err)
  })
```

### Deleting the contents of a Folder

To delete all the content of a Folder, use the [clear](#clear) or [clearSync](#clearsync) method of a Folder instance:

```ts
folder
  .clear()
  .then((result) => {
    // successful delete
  })
  .catch((rerror) => {})

// OR

folder.clearSync((error) => {})
```

### Deleting a folder

To delete a folder, use the `remove` or `removeSync` method:

```ts
folder
  .remove()
  .then((value: boolean) => {
    console.log(value)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.message)
  })
```

### Creating, writing to and reading from a text file

<!-- Preview: https://stackblitz.com/edit/nativescript-stackblitz-templates-5yndru?file=app/main-view-model.ts -->

- To create a file, call the `getFile()` method on an instance of the `Folder` class and pass it the file name with the extension.

```ts
folder.getFile('my-text.txt')
//or
const filePath = path.join(folder.path, 'my-text.txt')
const file = File.fromPath(filePath)
```

- To save a text to a file, use the `writeText` or `writeTextSync` method:

```ts
file
  .writeText('Some text')
  .then((result) => {
    // Succeeded writing to the file.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

- To extract data from a text file, you can use the readText or readTextSync method of the file instance. Here's an example of how to use it:

```ts
file
  .readText()
  .then((res) => {
    // Succeeded read from file.
  })
  .catch((error) => {})
```

### Check if a file exists

To check if a file exists, you can use [exists](#exists) with the file path:

```ts
const exists = File.exists(filePath)
```

### Renaming a file

To rename a file, use the `rename` or `renameSync` method:

```ts
file
  .rename('new-name.ext')
  .then((value) => {})
  .catch((err) => {})
```

### Saving a binary data to a file

<!-- TODO: binary data example -->

To save binary data to a file, use either the `write` or `writeSync` method:

```ts
file
  .write(binary data)
  .then(result => {
    // Succeeded writing to the file.

  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
  })

```

### Reading a binary data from a file

To read binary data, use the `read` or `readSync` method of the File instance. For example, you can save an image on the device and retrive it as follows:

```ts
async readAnImage() {

    const folder = knownFolders.documents()
    const filePath = path.join(folder.path, 'cat.png')
    const imageFile = File.fromPath(filePath)

    try {

      const imageSource = await ImageSource.fromFile('~/assets/images/download.jpeg')
      const saved: boolean = imageSource.saveToFile(filePath, "png")

      if (saved) {
        // READ BINARY DATA
        const imageBinary = await imageFile.read()
        const img = await ImageSource.fromData(imageBinary)
      }

    } catch (err) {

    }
}
```

### Deleting a file

To remove a file, use the [remove](#remove) or [removeSync](#removesync) method of the File instance:

```ts
file
  .remove()
  .then((res: boolean) => {
    // Success removing the file.
  })
  .catch((err) => {})
```

### Normalizing a path

To normalize a path use the `normalize` or create the path with the `join` method from the [path](#path-operations) object:

```ts
const testPath = '///test.txt'
let documentsFolder = knownFolders.documents()
path.normalize(documentsFolder.path + testPath)
```

## FileSystem API

### documents()

```ts
const folder: Folder = knownFolders.documents()
```

Gets the Documents folder available for the current application. This Folder is private for the application and not accessible from Users/External apps.

---

### externalDocuments()

```ts
const folder: Folder = knownFolders.externalDocuments()
```

Gets the Documents folder available for the current application from an external storage source. This folder has private access, with availability limited to the application, meaning it is not accessible to outside users, bots or external apps.

- On Android, for such read or write access, the flags `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions need to be set to true. This can be done by adding the following XML code to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

- There is no external storage on iOS, it is the same as [documents()](#documents).

---

### temp()

```ts
const folder: Folder = knownFolders.temp()
```

Gets the Temporary (Caches) folder available for the current application. This Folder is private for the application and not accessible from Users/External apps.

---

### currentApp()

const folder: Folder = knownFolders.currentApp()
